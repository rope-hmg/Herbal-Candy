# Herbal Candy

A register based virtual machine written in Rust.

Current status: **Very WIP**

The project is structured as a workspace, but I'm not currently taking advantage of that. All the code is in the `apps/ok` package. As the project matures, the pieces that want to be split out will present themselves.
